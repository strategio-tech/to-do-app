# ToDo App

This is a command-line interface app. <br/>
The tasks specified below will allow you to practice implement topics such as conditionals, Collections, and Streams.

### Complete the below tasks

- [ ] Sort To-Do items by name: Modify the viewItemsByOrder method to use Java Streams and Comparator to sort by name.
- [ ] Sort To-Do items by due date: Use Streams to sort by the due date.
- [ ] View not-started items: Filter ToDo items using Streams where the status is NOT_STARTED.
- [ ] Delete an item by name: Practice searching and deleting an item from an ArrayList using loops or removeIf.
### The tasks below require you to modify the existing code and add new methods.
- [ ] Update To-Do status: Add functionality to update an item's status to IN_PROGRESS or FINISHED.
- [ ] Display tasks in reverse order: Add an option to display all to-do items in reverse order (by name or due date).
- [ ] View items due before today: Use Streams to filter items whose due date is before the current date.
- [ ] Mark overdue items: Add a feature to mark items as overdue if their due date has passed.
- [ ] Add task descriptions: Expand the display of tasks to show more detailed descriptions and due dates.
- [ ] Use of HashMap: Create a HashMap of to-do items categorized by status (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, FINISHED).
- [ ] View items grouped by status: Use the HashMap to group and display tasks based on their status.
- [ ] Ensure no duplicate names: When adding new items, check if an item with the same name already exists.
- [ ] List completed tasks only: Add an option to display only FINISHED tasks.
- [ ] Modify task descriptions: Add a command to update an existing task's description.
- [ ] Sort tasks alphabetically and display: Modify the display order of tasks alphabetically using sort().
- [ ] Add due date validation: Implement a validation step for due dates to ensure they are in the correct format.
- [ ] Display tasks in a custom format: Format task output with additional formatting (e.g., indentation or bullet points).
- [ ] List all due tasks: Display a list of tasks due today or tomorrow.
- [ ] Toggle status between IN_PROGRESS and FINISHED: Add functionality to toggle between statuses.
- [ ] Compare ArrayList and Array: Write code that stores to-do items in an array and compare the effort with ArrayList.
- [ ] Use Streams to count tasks: Implement a Stream to count the number of tasks in each status category.
- [ ] Use logical operators in conditions: Implement complex conditions (e.g., tasks due tomorrow AND IN_PROGRESS).
- [ ] Refactor your code for options to be displayed logically so there are never more than 5 options available at any one time.

Ensure you are pushing your code in increments instead of waiting until the end to follow best practices in code development.
